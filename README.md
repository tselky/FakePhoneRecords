# FakePhoneRecords
 Generates Synthetic datasets of phone records in any size. Used to train the SVM model in TheBrain.py.
 This was a fluff project and not intended to be used to detect real spam calls. 
 
 The model is intended to be trained with data from GeneratorNum.py as it requires the 1/0 column population to work.
 
 To better visualize how the data looks, Generator.py will display much more information such as call duration and yes/no columns and the actual phone numbers.
